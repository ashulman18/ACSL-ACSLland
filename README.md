# ACSLland
December 2014 ACSL Senior Project

In taking a vacation trip, MapQuest and Google Maps provide very valuable information. 
Newer versions of these on-line tools provide not only the distance traveled, but also
how long it will take you and how much it will cost for gasoline. ACSL staff members live 
in different cities and have to meet for contest work sessions, so they need to know when they will meet.
In this program, they will be traveling a route in a particular region of ACSLland with all destinations
given in alphabetical order. The information between each pair of adjacent cities on your route is given below:
   A to B - 450 miles D to E – 365 miles G to H – 380 miles
  B to C – 140 miles E to F – 250 miles H to J – 235 miles
  C to D – 125 miles F to G – 160 miles J to K – 320 miles
  
For example, if two staff members from cities A and C (590 miles apart) need to meet with one staff member traveling 
at 50 miles per hour and starting at 1 PM and the other traveling at 60 miles per hour but starting at 2:00 PM, 
the 2 cars will meet in 5 hours and 55 minutes or “5:55”.
